This repo contains source code for Timelogger, a prototype web application that will help small-to-medium organizations manage their grants.

Notable features:

* JS timers to help you log grant time in real time;
* User-friendly record display and filtering;

* Security: your information is protected by state-of-the-art encryption;
* Easy registration for users and organizations;
* Multitenant structure through 'acts_as_tenant' gem;
* Many others.

To be developed before deployment:

 * Export CSV/Excel spreadsheets capability;
